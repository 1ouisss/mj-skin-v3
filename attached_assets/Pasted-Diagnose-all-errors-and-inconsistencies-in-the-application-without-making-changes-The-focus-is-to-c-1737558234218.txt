Diagnose all errors and inconsistencies in the application without making changes. The focus is to collect and understand the root causes of the issues.

Prompt:

Router Context and Navigation Issues:
Identify if all components using useNavigate() or useLocation() are properly wrapped within a <Router> component.
Log all route transitions and ensure no infinite loops or invalid redirects.
Ask for:

Current route paths during navigation.
Specific components triggering navigation unexpectedly.
Confirmation if navigation logic (e.g., <Navigate> or useEffect) is behaving as expected.
State Management Issues:
Check if QuizContext or other context providers are losing state across components.
Identify any issues with localStorage or location.state usage.
Ask for:

The current state in QuizContext or any shared state.
Logs of state transitions between pages.
Missing or invalid data in state.
Component Rendering Issues:
Confirm if components are rendering as expected without errors.
Identify if components mount and unmount unexpectedly.
Ask for:

Logs of component lifecycle (mounting/unmounting).
Any React warnings or errors during rendering.
Specific components failing to render properly.
API Call and Data Handling Issues:
Verify that all API calls succeed and return valid data.
Check if the data structure matches the expected format in components.
Ask for:

Logs of API request and response data.
Any API errors or failed fetches.
Invalid or undefined data passed to components.
Error Boundaries:
Confirm if error boundaries are properly logging and catching all rendering errors.
Identify uncaught exceptions or issues in rendering.
Ask for:

Logs of all caught errors and their stack traces.
Uncaught errors in the browser console.
General Logs and Browser Console Errors:
Collect all console warnings and errors during runtime.
Focus on React warnings, navigation errors, and invalid prop usage.
Ask for:

Logs of all warnings and errors during app execution.
Specific error messages related to routing, state, or rendering.
Instructions for Debugging:
Run the application in Replit.
Open the browser console (F12) and log all route changes, navigation triggers, and errors.
Observe state transitions and data flow in key components (Index, Recommendations, QuizContext).
Share complete logs for analysis.
Expected Output:

Detailed logs of router, state, component, API, and error-related issues.
Specific insights into navigation loops, missing state, or rendering errors.
