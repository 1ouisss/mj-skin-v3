b. Navigation Loops: Verify the navigation logic in the Quiz and Recommendations components, ensuring they correctly handle the quiz state and completion.
c. Error Boundaries: Add error boundaries to catch and handle any routing-related errors.
State Management Issues:
a. QuizContext Persistence: Ensure the QuizContext properly persists the state to localStorage and restores it on initialization.
b. State Validation: Improve the state validation logic in the QuizContext, handling edge cases and providing clear feedback to the user.
c. State Restoration: Verify the state restoration process in the QuizContext, ensuring it properly handles incomplete or corrupted state.
Build/Compilation Errors:
a. Module Resolution: Check the import statements and module resolution across the codebase, fixing any TypeScript or Vite-related issues.
b. Duplicate Declarations: Identify and remove any duplicate component declarations or exports.
Connection Issues:
a. Vite Server Connectivity: Ensure the Vite configuration is set up correctly, including any necessary HMR (Hot Module Replacement) settings.
b. WebSocket Failures: Investigate and resolve any WebSocket connection issues that may be causing the server connection losses.
Component Lifecycle Issues:
a. LoadingScreen Management: Optimize the LoadingScreen component to avoid rapid mounting and unmounting, potentially by using state to control its visibility.
b. State Persistence: Verify that the component state is properly maintained across route changes, potentially by using the QuizContext or other state management techniques.
c. Error Handling: Ensure the error boundaries are set up correctly to catch and handle all potential errors in the application.
Data Flow Issues:
a. API Endpoint Configuration: Ensure the Recommendations API endpoint in server.js is properly set up and handling the expected query parameters.
b. Error Handling: Add comprehensive error handling to the API calls in the Recommendations component, providing meaningful feedback to the user.
c. Data Validation: Implement robust data validation in both the frontend form submissions and the backend API responses.
